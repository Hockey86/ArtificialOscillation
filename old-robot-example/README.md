# causalrobot

Build a Raspberry Pi (RPi) robot which initially has zero knowledge and gradually learns how to walk, using causal inference and reinforcement learning!

* Step 1: Buy the devices from Amazon

    * Raspberry Pi starter kit: https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Ultimate-Starter-Clear/dp/B07BC567TW
    * Servo control board: https://www.amazon.com/MakerFocus-Resolution-Interface-Compatible-Raspberry/dp/B07H9ZTWNC
    * Servo power supply: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078RXZM4C
    * Servos (10 pieces): https://www.amazon.com/Cenrkay-Micro-Helicopter-Aircraft-Control/dp/B07N1C8D2F
    * Sensor (2x ultrasonic distance sensor): https://www.amazon.com/XiaoR-GEEK-Ultrasonic-Distance-Raspberry/dp/B07B94C7KT

* Step 2: Design robot body using LibreCAD https://librecad.org/

* Step 3: Configure your RPi. Install ROS (kinetics) on RPi.
