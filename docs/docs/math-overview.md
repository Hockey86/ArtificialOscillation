# Overview

The robot (he/his) lives in an environment. He can move its joints to interact with the environment. Everyday, he undergoes 4 NREM-REM sleep cycles, and then wakes up. During NREM sleep, he thinks about the principles of the environment and make corrections to its internal environment model. During REM sleep, he acts in the infered environment with much higher chance of illogic (random, non-optimal) actions. During wake, he acts logically (optimally) to check if the environment's response is the same with what he expects during sleep.

However, this is not all what he does. He needs energy to survive. During NREM sleep, his energy decays slowly. During REM sleep, his energy decays a bit faster. During wake, his energy decays even faster during resting, and decays the fastest during action. He needs food. Food is water. Water offers very low energy, but they are in fixed positions.
[]: # "There are three types of food - water, plants, and animals. Plants offer lower energy, but they are static, and appears and disappears according to a rule (with randomness) that is unknown to him. For animals, there are two subtypes, weaker than robot and stronger than robot. The weaker type offers high energy, but they follow a simple rule that they run away if the robot is near; The stronger type offers low energy, and they follow a simple rule to move towards the robot to eat it (to defeat it there must be multiple robot, or attack??)"

The sleep-wake cycle is explained in more detail in the following sections.
